# SwiftAuth
Fuzzy logic for simple, secure and faster alternative to authenticate access to web applications, using facial recognition and fingerprint access.

SwiftAuth

SwiftAuth uses a combination of facial and vocal recognition to authenticate users quickly and seamlessly on all the web apps that they love.

Our goal is to focus on utilizing biometrics to not only make user authentication technically more secure, but also faster and seamless from a social and psychological perspective. A lot of malicious hacking is done through social flaws, and we want to address that by making a product that makes the client's experience as easy as possible without letting go of security. Users of SwiftAuth can login without touching a keypad, and without having to memorize a password.

On entering a non-signed in website, we immediately draw up a small pop up window that utilizes the webcam. Immediately afterwards, we use the mic to validate users with this two factor authentication method under 5 seconds. This process is superbly fast and very comparable to the time it takes to type in one's password.

Use Case One

Alice logs into many accounts through her browser everyday, and has ended up using password managers such as LastPass and OnePass because she can no longer memorize all her passwords. She starts using SwiftAuth, and after a quick initial registration process, she now glances at her webcam and says a short phrase that appears on her screen to sign into all her accounts. No more having to worry about how many capitalized vs. numbers vs. special characters she had in a specific password.

Use Case Two

Alice's father, Bob, needs to take care of some bills but can't get to his credit card account as he is currently in a foreign country where many websites are blocked. Alice has the SwiftAuth extension on her browser and goes to log onto Bob's credit card account to help him pay the bills. She can't log in directly but can send Bob a link which will authenticate Bob through facial and voice recognition. Alice calls Bob and tells him she sent him an authentication link and after Bob is authenticated, she gains access to his account. Bob seamlessly managed to get his bills paid without having to change his password or disclose a password he uses for many of his other accounts
